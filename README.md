# Project:
Our project is a tower defense type game. It will  be a Java desktop application. 

Tower defense is a strategy game. There are separate waves of monsters with distinct powers and lifespans that try to  reach the end point.  By placing  towers with different capabilities, the player tries to prevent the  monsters from reaching the endpoint.  Each tower has a separate price and  the player can only earn money by killing enemies.  The player will have a fixed amount of money at the beginning of every level.  After all the waves  of monsters end,  the player wins.
